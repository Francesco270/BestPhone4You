TODO List:
  ☐ index.php
    ☐ Add an animation to the Smartphones images
  ☐ results_page.php:
    ☐ If only one Smartphone is found, then a special screen has to be shown
      "Something like 'This is the Smartphone which is the best for you'"
    ☐ If only one Smartphone is found, then the price sort <select> must not be shown
      It would have no sense to show the price sort filter with only one Smartphone,
      since there is nothing to sort
    ✔ Implement "Complete" view mode
    ☐ Implement price sorting feature
    ✔ Free all the session variables at the end
    ☐ Implement Feedback feature using a form that the user can display at the end
    ☐ Implement session saving and results page sharing feature via URL
    ☐ Show a different intro message if a user opens a shared URL
    ✔ Implement session recovery feature
      If the page is refreshed or closed, or a network problem occurs,
      then the user is asked if he wants to resume the procedure where
      it was left, or if he wants to restart again.
    ☐ Implement visualization of questions and answers
    ☐ Implement other shop selection for a given smartphone
      In this way the user can view other prices that other shops
      offer for a specific smartphone, in addition to the main shop
      that has the best price
  ☐ Other:
    ✔ Change iOS Logo Word Mark with a bolder one
    ✔ Sanitize and do proper checks to the responses values
    ☐ Use the EM unit for the font-sizes and other sizes
    ☐ Find another way to retrieve informations of questions and answers, to avoid redundancy
      ... this data can be found twice in the questions' templates and in ./models/questions_and_answers.php.
      That's not good. This data has to be defined only once
    ☐ Reorganize CSS
    ☐ Ensure that all the price ranges are covered

Optional things to do:
  ☐ Allow only one tab to be opened in order to avoid session problems
  ☐ Create accordion buttons to open or close the specs category for the complete view mode on mobile
      ... since it's very long to display
