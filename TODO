TODO List:
  ☐ results_page.php:
    ✔ If only one Smartphone is found, then a special screen has to be shown @done
      "Something like 'This is the Smartphone which is the best for you'"
    ✔ Implement "Complete" view mode
    ✔ Implement price sorting feature
    ✔ If only one Smartphone is found, then the price sort <select> must not be shown @done
      It would have no sense to show the price sort filter with only one Smartphone,
      since there is nothing to sort
    ✔ Free all the session variables at the end
    ✔ Implement Feedback feature using a form that the user can display at the end
    ✔ Implement session saving and results page sharing feature via URL
    ✘ Show a different intro message if a user opens a shared URL
      Maybe this has no sense...
    ✔ Implement session recovery feature
      If the page is refreshed or closed, or a network problem occurs,
      then the user is asked if he wants to resume the procedure where
      it was left, or if he wants to restart again.
    ✔ Implement visualization of questions and answers
    ✔ Implement other shop selection for a given smartphone
      In this way the user can view other prices that other shops
      offer for a specific smartphone, in addition to the main shop
      that has the best price
    ☐ If a shared results page does not produce results, show a notice
      (This can happen, because the prices have changed or the smartphones have been removed)
  ☐ Other:
    ✔ Change iOS Logo Word Mark with a bolder one
    ✔ Sanitize and do proper checks to the responses values
    ☐ Use the EM unit for the font-sizes and other sizes
    ✔ Find another way to retrieve informations of questions and answers, to avoid redundancy
      ... this data can be found twice in the questions' templates and in ./models/questions_and_answers.php.
      That's not good. This data has to be defined only once
    ☐ Reorganize CSS
    ☐ Ensure that all the price ranges are covered
    ☐ Use absolute paths instead of relative paths when requiring/including files
    ☐ Normalize URLs of Smartphones Shops Products Pages by removing query strings and other unneeded data
    ☐ Replace default 404 error page with the custom one created

Optional things to do:
  ☐ Use pretty URLs for the results page sharing
  ☐ Sort options by price (ascent mode) in the all shops purchase options box
  ☐ Improve accessibility by adding alternative style to focused elements
  ☐ index.php
    ☐ Add an animation to the Smartphones images
  ☐ Allow only one tab to be opened in order to avoid session problems
  ☐ Create accordion buttons to open or close the specs category for the complete view mode on mobile
      ... since it's very long to display
  ☐ Display the last update datetime for Smartphones prices
